# 👋 Hi, I'm Brad Conlin

I'm a Canadian engineer and founder of **Northstrike**, building advanced drone, robotics, and sensor systems for autonomous ISR and off-grid deployment.

---

### 🚀 What I Build

- 🛩️ **Modular drone swarms** – Fixed-wing & multirotor designs with AI coordination
- 🧠 **Onboard autonomy** – ROS 2, PX4, vision-based nav, and decentralized logic
- 🧪 **Simulation pipelines** – Gazebo + PX4 SITL for real-time training and testing
- 🛠️ **Rugged hardware** – Designed in Onshape, field-repairable, CNC and 3D printed
- 📡 **Swarm GCS** – Ground control station with TAK overlays & mission planner

---

### 🧱 Active Projects

- `northstrike-swarm-core` – PX4/ROS2 drone swarm stack (dev & simulation)
- `px4-autopilot-northstrike` – Fork of PX4 with custom models and tuning
- `hardware-prototypes` – Onshape & STL-based rugged drone platform (coming soon)
